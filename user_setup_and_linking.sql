-- Final User Setup and Linking SQL for KrishiBondhu
-- Execute this after creating users through Supabase Auth

-- Step 1: Create these users in Supabase Auth Dashboard first:
/*
REQUIRED USERS TO CREATE IN SUPABASE AUTH:
1. farmer@example.com (password: admin1234)
2. farmer2@example.com (password: admin1234)
3. farmer3@example.com (password: admin1234)
4. farmer4@example.com (password: admin1234)
5. customer@example.com (password: admin1234)
6. customer2@example.com (password: admin1234)
7. delivery@example.com (password: admin1234)
8. warehouse@example.com (password: admin1234)
9. admin@example.com (password: admin1234)

-- Instructions for manual execution
/*
EXECUTION STEPS:

1. First, create users in Supabase Auth Dashboard:
   - farmer@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - farmer2@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - farmer3@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - farmer4@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - customer@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - customer2@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - delivery@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - warehouse@example.com (password: admin1234)
   - admin@example.com (password: admin1234)

2. Then run this command to link everything:
   SELECT setup_all_user_links();

3. Verify the setup:
   SELECT * FROM verify_setup();

4. Check dashboard summary:
   SELECT * FROM dashboard_summary;

5. View recent activity:
   SELECT * FROM recent_platform_activity;
